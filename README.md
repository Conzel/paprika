# paprika
Paprika is an art project for the Museum of TÃ¼bingen, where a team of students visualize how a neural image classifer 
works. 

## Installation instructions
First download poetry. Then, with poetry install, switch to the directory root. Activate a shell using 

```poetry shell```

Then, install paprika using

```poetry install```

## Repository structure
- `scripts` contains everything that is directly executable and serves some testing purpose
- `paprika` is the main module and contains three submodules: `ai`, `cam` and `ui
- In each submodule, module's exports gets explicitly reimported in __init__.py. Module-internal files get prefaced with an
underscore

## Contributor Reminders 
- Format all code with `black` before commiting
- Use types in Python code where possible, check typing errors with `pyright`
- Add your dependencies to poetry, using `poetry add` or by hand
- Don't drop files into the repository route, use appropriate sub folders
- Write basic documentation where possible
- Write tests if possible
- If you change code, see if the tests still run
- Write sensible commit messages that precisely explain your changes
- Write commits that serve one purpose (f.e. don't mix up formatting/refactoring and adding features)
- Develop larger features on a separate branch. Always leave the main branch in an intact state
